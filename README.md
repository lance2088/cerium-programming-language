cerium-programming-language
===========================

Cerium is a programming language for the JVM
This project uses ANTLR for the lexer and parser generators

*** This project was inspired after reading the books "Language Implementation Patterns" and "The Definitive ANTLR Reference" by Terence Parr ***
*** The language is based off the Cymbol grammar from those books, but I plan to evolve it and change it considerably ***

I started a CeriumReferenceManual.pdf to describe the syntax and semantics of the language.
This document will eventually become the user guide, to help developers get started writing Cerium programs.

===========================

To run this project you need to install the following development stack:

(1) Eclipse Indigo
  - I haven't tried other versions of Eclipse, so I'm not sure how it will work with newer versions

(2) ANTLR 3.2
  (a) I'll eventually upgrade to ANTLR 4

(3) JDK 6
