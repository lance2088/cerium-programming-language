cerium-programming-language
===========================

A programming language that utilizes ANTLR and runs on the JVM

*** This was inspired after reading the books "Language Implementation Patterns" and "The Definitive ANTLR Reference" by Terence Parr ***
*** It's based off the Cymbol grammar from those books, but I plan to evolve it and change it considerably ***

===========================

Prerequisites:

(1) Eclipse Indigo
  - I haven't tried other versions of Eclipse, so I'm not sure how it will work with newer versions

(2) ANTLR 3.2
  (a) I'll eventually upgrade to ANTLR 4

(3) JDK 6
