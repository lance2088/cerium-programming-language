TODO list:

Semantic Analysis:
- add static type safety
- add polymorphic type safety

Code Generation:
- Build the code generator
  - I'll use Jasmin or some other utility to generate JVM bytecodes
  
Additional Language Features:
- add access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- add ability to reference/include classes defined in other files
- console I/O and file I/O
	- need to decide if I'm going to have a runtime library for things like file I/O and console I/O, etc. or if I'll just generate bytecodes for all of it
