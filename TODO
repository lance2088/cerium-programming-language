TODO list:

- Build the code generator
  - I'll use Jasmin or some other utility to generate JVM bytecodes
- add more primitive types
- auto promote types
- add ability to reference/include classes defined in other files
- need to decide if I'm going to have a runtime library for things like file I/O and console I/O, etc. or if I'll just generate bytecodes for all of it
