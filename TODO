TODO list:

Bugs:
	- (x + y) + 3 never finds the "3" when walking the types

Documentation:
- Finish the CeriumReferenceManual.pdf
	- This is somewhat dependent on the code generator being completed
- Add documentation for each class and its methods
	- JavaDoc is one step
	- Adding a Developer Manual is another important piece, so that we can quickly see which class is responsible for what (lexing, parsing, semantics, etc.)

Semantic Analysis:
- more testing

Code Generation:
- Build the code generator
  - I'll use StringTemplate and Jasmin to generate JVM bytecodes
  
Additional Language Features:
- add strings as a type
- add a for loop
- do we need a "this" and "super" ?
- add access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- add ability to reference/include classes defined in other files
- console I/O and file I/O
	- need to decide if I'm going to have a runtime library for things like file I/O and console I/O or if I'll just generate bytecodes for all of it (so we won't need to carry around a runtime library)
